02/01/2011:
	Release 1.2
	Bug Fixes:
	1)Sequence number adjustments so that Tcptrace RTT graphing/statistics now work

01/19/2011:
	Release 1.1
	Bug Fixes:
	1)Ack Vector computations were using one byte beyond the ack vector.
	2)Ack Vector to SACK was using one byte beyond the ack vector.
	Improvements:
	1)All error output now goes to stderr
	2)Multiple Debug Levels
	3)Moved includes, struct defs, and some functions defs to a header file
	New Features:
	1)Sync and SyncAck packets now have zero data and zero window. This makes them show up more easily in Tcptrace


12/22/2010:
	Release 1.0
	Initial Public Release
	Features:
	1)Converts DCCP to TCP
	2)Optional ack vectors to SACKS
	3)Optional Window to highest ack
	Bugs:
	1)Supports only a single DCCP connection per capture.
	2)Source Port can't equal Destination Port. If the two are equal, this program will get very confused.
	3)DCCP MUST use 48 bit sequence numbers.
	4)Checksums are not computed (they are zeroed).
	5)Only converts those packet types used by the Linux implementation at this date
	6)DCCP Ack packets show up as TCP packets containing one byte
	7)Very little error checking of packet headers, it's research software afterall
