This program converts a DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) packet capture
in PCAP format into a TCP packet capture in PCAP format with the intention that
that capture be analysed with tcptrace (http://www.tcptrace.org) in order to generate
graphs/stats to understand the DCCP protocol.


In order to build this program, please simply type make at the commandline. I have not
included a ./configure script with this program because this program will only compile
on linux anyway (we need the dccp header include file) and it comprises only one file.
If you have problems, simply modify the make file as needed. Contact me, if major problems
arise.

In order to utilize this program effectively you will also need Tcptrace, which you can download
from http://www.tcptrace.org and the version of xplot available from http://www.tcptrace.org under
"Useful Companion Programs" (Note! This is not the xplot that is in the Ubuntu repositories).


Usage is pretty simple:
dccp2tcp dccp_file tcp_file [-d] [-y] [-g] [-s]
	-d is debug
	-y shifts the window line in tcptrace (yellow) to the highest received acknowledgment. Normally this line is just a constant amount more than the ack number(i.e. useless).
	-g shifts the ack line in tcptrace (green) to the highest received acknowledgment. Normally this line is the standard TCP ack number, which, for DCCP, translates to the highest contiguous acknowledgement in the ack vector.
	-s converts the DCCP ack vector to TCP SACKS.

For typical usage, you probably just want -s.

Once you run dccp2tcp, you will then want to run tcptrace on the tcp_file to generate graphs. The command should be something like this:
tcptrace -lGt tcp_file

You can then use xplot to view the resulting graphs, like this:
xplot a2b_tsg.xpl a2b_rtt.xpl


This program does have several important limitations:
	1)Supports only a single DCCP contection per capture.
	2)Source Port can't equal Destination Port. If the two are equal, this program will get very confused.
	3)DCCP MUST use 48 bit sequence numbers.
	4)Checksums are not computed (they are zeroed).
	5)Only converts those packet types used by the Linux implementation at this date
	6)DCCP Ack packets show up as TCP packets containing one byte
	7)Very little error checking of packet headers, it's research software afterall
